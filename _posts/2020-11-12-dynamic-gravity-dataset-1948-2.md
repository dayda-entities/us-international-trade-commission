The gravity data describes country characteristics and relationships between two trading partners. This data covers a total of 285 countries between 1948 and 2016 and contains more than 60 variables describing macroeconomic indicators, geographic characteristics, trade facilitation measures, cultural relationships, and institutional stability measures.  In order to accurately reflect the dynamic nature of the globe, the dataset follows the formation and dissolution of countries each year and features extensive time variation in corresponding variables.
