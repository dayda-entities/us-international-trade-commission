The database contains index measures of linguistic similarity both domestically and internationally. The domestic measures capture linguistic similarities present among populations within a single country while the international indexes capture language similarities between two different countries. The indexes reflect three aspects of language: common official languages, common native languages, and linguistic proximity across languages.
